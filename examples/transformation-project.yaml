# A Zyp Transformation [1] project file to support importing
# MongoDB collections from ACME [2] into CrateDB [3].
#
# The transformation recipe includes expressions mostly
# written in jqlang [4], and can be used as a pipeline step
# for data transfer operations, either standalone, or through
# CrateDB Toolkit [5].
#
# Because CrateDB can not store different data substructures of MongoDB 1:1,
# mostly revolving around dynamic schema evolution genesis, a few
# transformations and treatments need to be applied to make the data import
# work well and sensible.
