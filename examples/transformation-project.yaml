# A Tikray project transformation [1] file for harmonizing structural
## differences on a single JSON file.
#
# The transformation recipe includes expressions mostly
# written in jqlang [2], and can be used as a pipeline step
# within data transfer operations, either standalone, or through
# corresponding SDKs.
